# ChangeFace-as
i cannot push libopencv_java.so here ,maybe it is my net's problem or the git/github limit, thus you need to put the file to jniLibs/armeabi-v7a
###update here
i finally push libopencv_java.so here, and i check it out that it is for my limited shadowsocks proxy, thus i set up shadowsocks proxy server over my aws machine.
